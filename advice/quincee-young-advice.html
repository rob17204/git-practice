                <h4>It's okay to ask questions!</h4>
                <p>When you start your journey with Skillcrush, you are going to have a million questions. Coding is not a simple task, and it takes a lot of big brain energy.
                    As you go through the course you'll notice that you may not understand things perfectly, that would be because you are a BEGINNER! If you are anything like me, 
                    you like to know things perfectly and have a desire to be talented at something right off the bat. This has never gotten me very far, and the greatest thing you
                    can do for youself as you learn this new skill is to give yourself the grace to grow!  .</p>

                <p>That being said, there are many resources out there to help you through the course. Use those resources to ask your questions. Learn to be a problem solver. I believe
                    that will be what gets us far in the tech world!</p>

                <h4>Make sure your expectations match your ability to perform.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning something new, sometimes our expectations start out large and slowly get smaller as we take in more and more. The expectations we have for ourselves may need to change
                    when we realize the task at hand may be more difficult or require more time and energy then we previously thought. This is more than okay! If you come in with expectations and fill you are unable
                    to perform at a level that reaches those expecations, then change them!
