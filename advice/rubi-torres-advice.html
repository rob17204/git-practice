        <h4>Believe in yourself!</h4>
        <p>
          <em>Practice makes perfect</em> is what I was told as a little girl
          and it has stuck with me ever since. I've come to learn over the years
          that belief in yourself can take you farther than you can imagine. So
          I'm here to tell you future Skillcrusher to never ever give up on
          yourself, always believe whole heartedly and you will achieve your
          dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you know in life we are faced with challenges every day, big or
          small and it is no different then when you are trying to learn a new
          skill or language, and yes of course, learning how to code. If you are
          here reading my advice, that is proof that you believe in yourself!
          and as a fellow Skillcrusher I am very proud of you so please keep
          going. Continue to show up and show out for yourself. You got this
          Skillcrusher! I believe in you!
        </p>

        <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
        <p>
          When you start programming your first web app you are doing something
          that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new
          opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so
          specific that it's probably never been done before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
          direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving
          pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig
          deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.
        </p>

        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to
          write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,
          you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code
          you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW
          exactly it's happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.
